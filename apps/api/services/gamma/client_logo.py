"""JJ-27: where an uploaded client logo appears in a Gamma deck, and what
happens when it is missing or too poor to place.

The Borek logo is part of the locked template and is never affected by any of
this. The client logo is co-branding: it appears bottom-right on the cover and
closing cards only, never on content cards. A logo that fails the quality gate
is dropped rather than stretched, and the cover falls back to the client name
wordmark that `cover.client_name` already carries.
