"""Master Presentation V2: generation request, status and the checks the worker runs.

V2 is a new version of the opportunity's one Master Presentation (the same ``presentation_id``
as V1): the unchanged canonical deck followed by a post-meeting appendix. A generation is only
accepted when the Post Meeting review reports that everything is ready, and it is built from a
snapshot frozen at that moment (``services.presentation.master_deck.v2``). The worker renders
the frozen plan; it never reads the live sources again.

The legacy standalone PPT #2 generator is not involved anywhere in this module.
